# Finch POC

Finch POC is a React application with a set of pre-configured dependencies useful for building robust user interfaces and interacting with the Finch APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

This project also uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

If you have git installed, you can clone the repository using: 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/adamglasser/finch_poc.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

After cloning the repository, enter the project directory:

```shell
cd app
```


3. **Install dependencies**

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the dependencies listed under `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run several scripts:

- **`npm start`**

Starts the development server and opens the application in your default browser. The app will reload if you make edits.
