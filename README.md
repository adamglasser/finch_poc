This repository contains two projects, each with their own README.

This is a demo app for fetching data from FINCH and is meant to be a POC

## App

This is where the  **Frontend** of the application is housed, and how it displays the data returned from the backend

[README](app/README.md)

## Server

This is where the  **Backend** of the application is housed, which fetches data from Finch and returns it to the frontend

[README](server/README.md)
