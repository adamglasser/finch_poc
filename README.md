# Finch POC

This repository contains two projects, each with their own README.

This is a demo app for fetching data from FINCH and is meant to be a POC

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

This project also uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

If you have git installed, you can clone the repository using: 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/adamglasser/finch_poc.git
```

2. **Set up Project Components**

There are separate README files for both the App and Server which is the backend of the application

## App

This is where the  **Frontend** of the application is housed, and how it displays the data returned from the backend

[README](app/README.md)

## Server

This is where the  **Backend** of the application is housed, which fetches data from Finch and returns it to the frontend

[README](server/README.md)
